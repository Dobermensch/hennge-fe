# Improvements

- Add a loading indicator as the mails are loaded via backend
- Allow users to search via other fields (From, To, Subject) rather than just date ranges by adding search bars for respective fields or one overloaded search bar.
- Instead of doing client-side date filtering, do a request to the backend.

# TODO
- Add tests
- Use SCSS in project
- Use TypeScript in project
